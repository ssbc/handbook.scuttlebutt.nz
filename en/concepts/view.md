> @bobhaugen you could certainly put those messages into ssb logs, although, there the definition of "single document" is weaker. For example, this thread is represented across your log, @paul's log and my log. Each message in the thread points back to the previous message it is acknowledging. You could consider that tree a "document" at a level above the logs.

Although, I'm imagining the amount of contracts a normal person enters into - other organizations, like companies - might do a huge amount and so some way of compacting that may be good.
