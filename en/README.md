## What Is Scuttlebutt?

Historically, sea-slang for gossip - a scuttlebutt is basically a watercooler on a ship.

Scuttlebutt is a decent(ralised) secure gossip platform.

## How To Get Started

The easiest way to get started is using [patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork), a classic social networking [application](./applications.md).

## Install Patchwork

### Download Installers for Windows, macOS and Linux

See [patchwork/releases](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases)

### Or Build from Source

With [node (>= 4) and npm (>= 2) installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork
$ cd patchwork
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

On Linux you'll need some more dependencies. On Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev g++ m4 automake libtool
```

### Be Invited To A Pub

In order to gossip outside your local network, you'll need to connect to a [Pub](./concepts/pub.md).

You can find an invite to an available pub at the [Pub servers registry](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers).

Get an invite, then in `patchwork`: click "+ Join Pub" and paste the invite code.

This will cause you to follow the Pub and vise versa. If you haven't synchronized to this social network yet, prepare to wait a few minutes while your local server synchronizes.
