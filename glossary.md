## Scuttlebot
 
An SSB server. Now named `ssb-server`.

## Gossip
 
A Peer-to-Peer networking technique where peers connect randomly to each other and ask for new updates.

## Pub Servers

SSB peers which run on public IPs, and provide connectivity and hosting for users on private IPs. Pubs are not privileged, and do not hold special authority in the network. They are not hosts.

## runcible

> I have decided that runcible means "fit for multiple purposes".
so, a spork is a runcible spoon, but a large ladle suitable (?) for catching frogs would also be called a "runcible spoon".
>
> Thus a folding bicycle, or bicycles which can carry large amounts of cargo, or turn into a boat, etc, are "runcible bikes" a flying car, or a amphibious car are both runcible cars.
>
> I feel this fits most of the way Lear uses "runcible", especially when he uses it just suggest silly person as a "runcible goose"

## uxer

> uxer is a sort of mashup shorthand for the user-experienceR, which is not the "experience" as perceived by others (UX) but the person who is getting treated... the uxer is the "UX Designer"
>
> In the context of p2p, uxer makes more sense, cuz we're flip the paradigm of ownership, and should be designing from the first person.
>
> IMHO the ultimate goal is for people to not only "own" their "experience", but design their own applications;  for the perfect world, the latter predicates the former;  to which ends, anarchitecture.
