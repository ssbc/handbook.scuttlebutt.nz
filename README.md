## How To Get Started

The easiest way to get started is using [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork), a classic social networking [application](./applications.md).

![screenshot of Patchwork](./assets/patchwork.jpg)

1. [Download an Installer](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux
2. Get a [pub invite code](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers)  
3. Use the pub invite : in Patchwork click `+ Join Pub` and paste the invite code

Step 2 is important if you want to be able to find people further than your local network - it sets you up with a robot friend on the internet which helps you find and communicate with people.
Read more about Pubs and their role [here](./concepts/pub.md).
