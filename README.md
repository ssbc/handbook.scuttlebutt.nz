## What Is Scuttlebutt?

Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is a protocol for peer-to-peer social networks. It helps describe peer identity, order messages as feeds, and allow secure gossip of updates on those feeds.

The name *Scuttlebutt* is historically [sea-slang for gossip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttlebutt) â€“ a scuttlebutt is basically a watercooler on a ship. Gossip protocols are [real science](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf).

## How To Get Started

SSB itself is just a protocol, while applications can make use of this protocol. The easiest way to get started is using [Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork), a social networking [application](./applications.md) based on SSB.

### Easy path

1. [Download an Installer](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux
2. Get a [pub invite code](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers)  
3. Use the pub invite: in Patchwork click `+ Join Pub` and paste the invite code

Step 2 is important if you want to be able to find people further than your local network - it sets you up with a robot friend on the internet which helps you find and communicate with people.

Read more about Pubs and their role [here](./concepts/pub.md).

### Build from Source

This is more technical than the easy path, mainly useful if you're interested in developing Patchwork.

On Linux you'll need some more dependencies. On Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev g++ m4 automake libtool
```

With [node (>= 4) and npm (>= 2) installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork
$ cd patchwork
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Follow steps `2.` and `3.` above to connect to the network.
