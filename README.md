## Ready to get started?

**We have a detailed [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) which is
recommended if you've got a few minutes.**

If you just need to get up and running ASAP here's what you need to know:

### Quick Start

1. [Download Patchwork](http://dinosaur.is/patchwork-downloader/), and install
   it like any other app. 
2. Boot it up and set up your profile. 
3. Go to [the list of pub servers](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers) and get an
   invite code from one.
4. Click "+ Join Pub" in the top left corner of Patchwork and paste in the
   invite code.  It's best to have multiple pub servers to extend your
   visibility into the network. 
5. Start browsing public posts and channels. Note that there's a "More Channels"
   button under the list of active channels. 
6. Subscribe to people and channels you find interesting. The more people you
   follow the more channels gossip will have to flow through to you.
7. Have fun, and be respectful of others. The scuttleverse is a nice place.
