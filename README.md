## What Is Scuttlebutt?

Historically, sea-slang for gossip - a scuttlebutt is basically a watercooler on a ship.

Scuttlebutt is a decent(ralised) secure gossip platform.

## How To Get Started

The easiest way to get started is using [patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork), a classic social networking [application](./applications.md).

### Easy path

1. [Download an Installer](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux
2. Get a [pub invite code](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers)  
3. Use the pub invite : in Patchwork click `+ Join Pub` and paste the invite code

Step 2 is important if you want to be able to find people further than your local network - it sets you up with a robot friend on the internet which helps you find and communicate with people.
Read more about Pubs and their role [here](./concepts/pub.md).


### Build from Source

This is more technical than the easy path, mainly useful if you're interested in developing Patchwork.

On Linux you'll need some more dependencies. On Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev g++ m4 automake libtool
```

With [node (>= 4) and npm (>= 2) installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork
$ cd patchwork
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Follow steps `2.` and `3.` above to connect to the network.
