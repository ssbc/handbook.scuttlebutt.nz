## How To Get Started

![screenshot of Patchwork](./assets/patchwork.jpg)

The easiest way to get started is using **Patchwork**, an application for navigating and talking on scuttlebutt.
1. [Download Patchwork](http://dinosaur.is/patchwork-downloader/) for Windows, macOS and Linux
2. Get a [pub invite code](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/wiki/Pub-Servers)  
3. Use the pub invite : in Patchwork click `+ Join Pub` and paste the invite code

Step 2 is important if you want to be able to find people further than your local network - it sets you up with a robot friend on the internet which helps you find and communicate with people.
Read more about Pubs and their role [here](./concepts/pub.md).
