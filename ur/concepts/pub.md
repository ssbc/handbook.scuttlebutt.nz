# Public Peers, aka "Pubs"

To sync across the Internet, "Pub" nodes run at public IPs and follow users. They are essentially mail-bots which improve uptime and availability.

The Scuttlebot community runs some Pubs, and anybody can create and introduce their own.

## Invite tokens

Tokens which may be used to command specific Pub servers to follow a user. These are used to join Pubs.

## Introducers

TODO

> an essential part of the idea with pubs was to use them as introducers like this. needing a signalling server for introductions seems centralizing, but if that service is generic and people have a reason for running them (as pubs have already demonstrated - already more people than we expected have decided to run pubs) then that service becomes decentralized.
