## runcible

> I have decided that runcible means "fit for multiple purposes".
so, a spork is a runcible spoon, but a large ladle suitable (?) for catching frogs would also be called a "runcible spoon".
>
> Thus a folding bicycle, or bicycles which can carry large amounts of cargo, or turn into a boat, etc, are "runcible bikes" a flying car, or a amphibious car are both runcible cars.
>
> I feel this fits most of the way Lear uses "runcible", especially when he uses it just suggest silly person as a "runcible goose"

## uxer

> uxer is a sort of mashup shorthand for the user-experienceR, which is not the "experience" as perceived by others (UX) but the person who is getting treated... the uxer is the "UX Designer"
>
> In the context of p2p, uxer makes more sense, cuz we're flip the paradigm of ownership, and should be designing from the first person.
>
> IMHO the ultimate goal is for people to not only "own" their "experience", but design their own applications;  for the perfect world, the latter predicates the former;  to which ends, anarchitecture.
