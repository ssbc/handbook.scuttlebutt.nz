## Patchwork

A remake of [Patchwork Classic](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork-classic) using [patchcore](https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore) and UX/ideas from [ferment](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment).

The goal is to make a standalone, easy to install, "social" view into the ssb world.

## Patchbay

Also built on [patchcore](https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore), but uses a tabbed interface instead and has some more bleeding edge features.

The goal is to make a client developers love - it comes with social views, as well as git interface into the scuttleverse.

## ssb-graphviz

An interactive visualisation of your local scuttleverse.
Fly with [w,a,s,d] and look with [up,left,down,right].
Hover over nodes to see who they are and light up their 1st and (dimmer) 2nd degree friendships.

## SSB stats

Posts published over time (from the perspective of Cel's pub server). Colors represent when that user first posted (so is a way of visualising cohorts).
