# How do we prevent harassment and spam?

Harassment is a problem on most online services.
The normal approach is to give users block or mute buttons or to have moderators.
All of these could be implemented on top of secure scuttlebutt.

Presently, there is a "flag" feature, which is an extremely strong negative signal.
If somebody is behaving poorly, feel free to flag them.
