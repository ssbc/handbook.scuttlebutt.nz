# How do new users join the system?

---

To join the network, a user needs to know a server in the system.
To have their data replicated, they need someone to follow them.

The simplest way to join the network is to use an invite code.
The invite code contains the address of a pub server, and a secret that commands the server to follow (and therefore replicate) the invite's user.
If you run your own pub server you can create invite codes and give them to your friends.
