# How do I reserve my user name?

---

Secure Scuttlebutt does not have unique user names, because that would require a central registry of names, and then the system would not be decentralized.

Instead, ssb's nicknames can be set locally.
If two of your friends pick the same name, then you can rename one to disambiguate them.

The web interface alerts the user to name conflicts, so that this can be resolved quickly.
