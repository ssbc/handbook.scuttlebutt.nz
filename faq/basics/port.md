# What public ports does Scuttlebot use?

*I know that scuttlebott is the client that connects my computer to others within this grand scuttleverse, but what ports does it need to make these connections?*

Scuttlebot uses the ports 8008 and 8989.

- 8008 is the port scuttlebot uses for gossip (reading and replicating your feed and the feed of your friends)
- 8989 is the port used for for websockets and hosting blobs (blobs are the files you can attach to your messages, like the images you add to your sweet posts.)
