# How do I upgrade to the lastest release of Patchwork?

---

When a new stable version of Patchwork is released, you'll be notified in a banner announcement when you launch Patchwork.

To upgrade to the newest stable version:

1. Click on the banner notification. This will take you to the [github page](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases) for the newest Patchwork versions.
2. Download the correct version for your operating system.
3. If it did not happen automatically, go ahead and close Patchwork. Some users report this was not necessary, others reported that not closing it during the upgrade process caused snags.
4. When the downloaded `.exe` file finishes downloading it, go ahead and launch it with the methods required by your operating system. For example, on a Windows machine, you would simply double click the file to begin the process.
5. When the installation is complete, re-launch Patchwork. It may take several minutes for the new version to reindex the entries the first time you use it.
