# Can I post from different devices?

*Or rather: can I use scuttlebutt on different devices, but maintain the same identity? For example: updating my Patchwork feed from my home and  work computer?*

Currently, you cannot.  Identities are tied to a single user on a single device.  You could use scuttlebutt on multiple devices, but you would be maintaining multiple identities and feeds.

There is an ongoing conversation around this, though, that you can follow here:
