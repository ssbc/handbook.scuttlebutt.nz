# How can I help?

*I want to get involved with this FAQ because I am awesome!*

---

You can help with the FAQ by asking a question, refining one of my answers, or submitting an entire question and answer.

This is all assembled by Gitbook, hosted  [here](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt.nz/tree/master/faq).

If that does not work, you can reach me through scuttlebutt.  My scuttlename is @ZqH7Mctu/7DNInxuwl12ECjfrAKUX2tBLq1rOldNhg0=.ed25519.  (caveat: searching by this will only work if we are in the same friend network.  But we prolly are.  I'm pretty social and this place is still small.)

I love any help you want to give, with one caveat: This FAQ is intended as a sort of "on-ramp" to the scuttleverse, and so meant to be simple.  I would love to have links to deeper and more technical resources, but this should not be seen as a FAQ for the highly technical stuff (so no questions about how to make an SSB app  with just tin cans, a hacked talkboy, and a cursory knowledge of LISP.)
*(Though as I write this I realize that answer would be super cool and so I urge you to start up an advanced FAQ if you're able.)*
