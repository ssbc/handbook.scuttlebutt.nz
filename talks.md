## The Internet in 2030

### André Staltz @ Mixit 19

> The centralizing powers of the internet are showing a need for radical change towards freedom and user rights. A new movement is building the new internet, but there are even more difficulties approaching: climate crisis, crowd social engineering, and the next impending economic crisis, all of which are interconnected. This talk will show you how we are coming to the end of an era, and how one promising approach can benefit the environment, the economy, humanity, and the internet: décroissance.

## Scuttlebutt and a Decentralized Future

### Zenna Fiscella @ Radical Networks 2018

> This talk is about Scuttlebutt and how it can be transformative for society, decentralizing and enabling local community development free of big corp. Scuttlebutt is a fast growing decentralized social network. As an alternative to the large corporate social networks it enables autonomy for the users and a free zone from big data harvesting.
>
> It’s based on a protocol (referred to as SSB) which connects the users via a blockchain base with each user functioning as a node. Since the information is collected via a 2 or 3 step social connection it’s completely usable while offline and syncs when connected to a local network, a friend or wifi.
>
> Scuttlebutt has a large community of users who together develop the platform. Completely open-source there are many initiatives of projects, maintenance and initiatives as part of the Scuttlebutt ecosystem. Some of these projects range from local community on-boarding by @luandro in Quilombola - Brazil, git-ssb by @cel, or a chess interface!
>
> As the Scuttlebutt interface is interchangeable, with the most widely used one being Patchwork, there is a possibility to utilize the same network with multiple applications. Perfect for local communities in rural areas or for environments which require offline workability, the potentials are grand. As of today the estimate is that the user base is beyond 10.000 individuals.

## Reinvent the Social Web

### André Staltz @ FullStackFest 2018

> The times we live in have made it necessary to disrupt mainstream social networks. In this talk, Andre will present Scuttlebutt, a decentralized social network protocol from the Node.js hacker community. We will see how it works from a programmer's perspective, and specially how to build social apps using it. With fully offline browsing, new types of interactions, cryptographic authenticity, and data ownership, several opportunities for innovation are unlocked.

### Anders (arj) @ Techfestival 2018

> A talk given at the [Algorithmic Sovereignty](http://algosov.org/) summit during Techfestival in Copenhagen. The talk touches on how Scuttlebutt can be used to regain some sovereignty over how data is shared and bring transparancy to the algorithms that runs on the data.

## What is the meaning of "decentralization"?

### Dominic Tarr @ DWebSummit 2018

> Taken literally, "decentralization" just means "not centralized", but what are the different ways something can be not centralized? Are there different types or flavors of decentralization that can be meaningfully distinguished?

## It's time to build our own Internet

### André Staltz @ TEDxGeneva

> The world is beginning to learn about problems of the smartphone era that affect everything from our minds to our politics. But the smartphones are not to be blamed. The infrastructure of the Internet, often hidden from our sight, provided the technological foundational for the problems we are seeing today. It is possible to build an alternative Internet made with modern wireless technologies and new software, that make a new foundation for freedom in the digital era. André is developing software for the new Internet, and blogs about the current macroscopic changes in Cyberspace. He wrote viral blog posts such as "The Web began dying in 2014", "A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet", and "Layers of the Internet Economy". He works as an open source programmer funded by donations, and is developing a free and decentralized social network for phones, together with other pioneers. André also teaches programming through workshops and conference talks, having had spoken at dozens of conferences around Europe.

## O fim da Internet

### André Staltz @ BrazilJS Conf 2017

> Nenhuma tecnologia desaparece da noite pro dia. Assim como o telefone fixo e o Flash, tecnologias sofrem uma gradual redução de uso que pode durar anos ou décadas até desaparecerem completamente. Os primeiros sinais do fim da internet original, aberta e decentralizada, já estão surgindo. Nesta palestra você vai descobrir quais são esses sinais, o que vai acontecer nos próximos anos, e como uma alternativa à internet está sendo criada, usando apenas JavaScript.

## The Decentralized Web

### André Staltz @ Hack\Talks in Helsinki, 2017

> André will cover of topics such as peer-to-peer browser, off-grid social network, and local development, and their underlying technologies Dat and SSB, both implemented in JavaScript / Node.js.

## Embracing Subjectivity

### Mix Irving @ nz.js(con); New Zealand JS Conference 2017

> Cast central authorities aside and take a tour of a inter-net conceived subjectively. Learn about the challenges and benefits of not having singlular sources of truth, and take a tour of the Scuttleverse - an actively growing decent community (of code and humans).
